# pupedock "Puppy Dok"
## Enterprise Puppet in a Docker container
### CentOS:6, because SystemD is dumber than Puppet.
* This container takes the better part of 6 minutes to boot on a midrange VM, and you have to kick off an Agent run once you log in which takes another ~4 minutes. So boot her in the morning and use ./Login.sh to access it.
